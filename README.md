# Deepfake_Detection_Audio_-_Video


# Overview

This project is a Deepfake Detection System that analyzes both video and audio files to determine if they have been manipulated using deepfake techniques. The system leverages deep learning for video detection and machine learning for audio detection, providing a comprehensive analysis for potential deepfake content.

# Features

Web-based Interface: Upload and analyze video and audio files separately.

Deep Learning for Video Analysis: Uses an Xception model to detect deepfake videos.

Machine Learning for Audio Analysis: Uses an SVM model to detect deepfake audio.

Flask Backend: Handles file uploads and processes video/audio deepfake detection.

JSON API Responses: Results are returned to the frontend for display.

# System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

**Frontend (Web UI)**

Users upload video/audio files.

Separate buttons for processing video and audio.

Displays results in real time.

**Backend (Flask API)**

Handles video and audio file uploads.

Routes for processing video and audio separately.

Sends detection results back to the frontend.

**Video Deepfake Detection**

Extracts frames from the uploaded video.

Uses a pretrained Xception-based model (deepfake_xception_model.h5).

Outputs "Fake Video" or "Real Video".

**Audio Deepfake Detection**

Extracts MFCC features from audio.

Uses an SVM model (trained_model.pkl) for classification.

Outputs "Fake Audio" or "Real Audio".
